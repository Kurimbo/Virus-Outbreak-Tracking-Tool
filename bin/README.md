    -   **ALWAYS** add a message so we know what you changed

        `git commit -m "Your message should go here"`

-   checkout:

# Step-by-step

1.  Use git clone to have the repository on your local computer.

2.  Create a branch with your name. `git branch <your_branch>`

3.  Go to **your** branch `git checkout <your_branch>`

4.  **Pull** the changes from the main branch `git pull origin main`

5.  **Commit** those changes so they can save locally `git commit -m "Your commit message"`

6.  Always check that you are in **your** branch with the following line (or with the tab on the right side of R studio)

7.  **Push** your changes to the remote branch `git push origin <your_branch`
